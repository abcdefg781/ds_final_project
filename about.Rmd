We limited our data to taxis going into manhattan due to the size of the data available. Our logic is that this also reflects the general habits of New Yorkers, as most of the main attractions of New York City reside in the borough of Manhattan. We have made graphical representations, such as [heatmaps](heatmaps.html), [time distribution graphs](timedist.html) and inferences on [congestion](congestion.html) to help illustrate where people are going and how far they are willing to travel for a night out on Valentine's day.
