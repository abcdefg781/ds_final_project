## History
<p> The New York City <b>Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC)</b> is an agency of the New York City government that licenses and regulates the medallion taxis and for-hire vehicle industries, including app-based companies.[1][2] The TLC's regulatory landscape includes medallion (yellow) taxicabs, green or Boro taxicabs, black cars (including both traditional and app-based services), community-based livery cars, commuter vans, paratransit vehicles (ambulettes), and some luxury limousines.[3]
