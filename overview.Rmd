## Data Overview

We limited our data to taxis going into Manhattan due to the size of the data available. Our logic is that this also reflects the general habits of New Yorkers, as most of the main attractions of New York City reside in the borough of Manhattan. We have made graphical representations, such as [heatmaps](heatmaps.html), [time distribution graphs](timedist.html) and inferences on [congestion](congestion.html) to help illustrate where people are going and how far they are willing to travel for a night out on Valentine's Day.

Upon an exploratory analysis of the dataset, we found that there were few rides coming from Staten Island into Manhattan. Therefore, we decided to focus on the other four boroughs for analysis, since there was not enough data from Staten Island to come up with meaningful interpretations.

## Trends

### Busiest Hours of the Day
The time distribution graphs showed that 6-9 PM were some of the most popular hours in all of the boroughs on Valentine’s Day. 8 AM was the busiest hour in Brooklyn and the Bronx, but after that, dinner hours were busiest in those two boroughs. The stacked histograms also showed that yellow cabs accounted for nearly half the rides in Manhattan, but were not nearly as popular in the other boroughs. There were still a decent amount of pickups with yellow cabs in Queens and Brooklyn, but in the Bronx, for-hire vehicles constituted the majority of pickups. 

Looking at the time distribution graphs for just the dinner hours, 7-8 PM seemed to be the most popular time to get picked up for dinner, but the difference between the three hours was minimal for pickups. In general, on Valentine’s Day, people were using cab services to get to work in the morning or to travel around dinner time.
