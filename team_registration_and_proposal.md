Team Registration and Proposal
================
11/7/2019

The group members for this project include:

  - Ngoc Duong: nqd2000
  - Sabrina Lin: stl2137
  - James Ng: nj2208
  - Adeline Shin: as5951

Our proposed project title is: Yellow/Green Taxi vs. Ride-Share Apps in
NYC

Motivation for the project: There are many taxi and for-hire vehicle
services available in New York, and we want to find out whether there
are differences between them in terms of location served, availability,
time of use, and fare.

The intended final products include:

  - A website containing information about the project and all
    visualizations
  - A map containing information about rides from different locations
  - A dashboard of visualizations

Our main data source will be from the [TLC Trip Record
Dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)

The planned analyses include:

  - Analysis of Yellow vs. Green Taxi Fares
  - Visualizations:
      - Concentration of Yellow vs. Green Cabs vs. Uber/Lyft at
        different times during the Day or Week (Map)
      - Concentration of yellow vs. green cabs vs. Uber in different
        neighborhoods of interest (map)
      - Regression models with outcome variables fares and tips using
        predictors such as: pickup/drop-off locations (neighborhoods),
        pick-up time, trip distance, wait time, potentially MTA train
        schedules/delays, traffic congestion, weather, gas cost, etc.

The Planned Timeline:

  - Data Downloading by Nov. 7
  - Data Cleaning by Nov. 10
  - Preliminary Descriptive of Dataaset by Nov. 12
  - Make Visualizations for Key Points by Nov. 19
  - Put Data Together by Nov. 26
  - Final Product by Dec. 3
  - Screen Recording by Dec. 4
